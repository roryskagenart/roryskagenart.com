## [3.2.0] - 2026-09-16

> **"Group" — the board becomes a real tool rather than a list.** The second release of the studio
> feedback & planning program. Releases become first-class, the board can be read grouped by them,
> a single item can be opened and triaged, the nav shows what is waiting, and new public
> submissions reach the studio in one batched email instead of one message each. Two migrations
> (both additive and idempotent), applied 2026-09-16.

### Added

- **Releases are now a real entity.** New table `public.plan_releases` (`version text UNIQUE`,
  `status ∈ planned|in_progress|shipped|cancelled`, `target_date`, `shipped_at`, `notes`) with RLS
  and one `is_admin_or_editor()` policy, plus `plan_items.release_id → plan_releases(id)`,
  **nullable and `ON DELETE SET NULL`** — deleting a release ungroups its items rather than
  deleting the studio's thinking with it. `GET`/`POST`/`PATCH`/`DELETE /api/plan/releases`, all
  `requireAuth` + `editor`.
  - ⚠️ **`shipped_at` is derived, never accepted from a request body.** Moving *to* `shipped`
    records it and keeps an existing one, so correcting a release's title cannot backdate it;
    moving *away* clears it, because "cancelled" and "shipped on the 12th" cannot both be true.
  - A duplicate `version` is a **409**, not a 500: `version` is the join key to the history.
- **The board can be read grouped by release.** A Flat / By-release toggle over the same rows.
  Every release gets a section including the empty ones, and there is always a *not filed under a
  release* bucket. Moving an item PATCHes `release_id` **by uuid** — never by version, because two
  releases can legitimately share a label across a rename.
- **The item drawer.** One item in full: triage (status/priority/kind), a one-step **promote** for
  a public suggestion (`suggestion` → `feature`/`bug`/`task`, with `source` staying `'public'`),
  and its provenance.
- **An unread badge on the Planning nav item.** Counts public submissions still `new`, fetched by
  the shell rather than by the page it points at — so it is correct before you visit it.
- **A batched email digest.** `GET /api/cron/plan-digest` (Vercel Cron, daily) sends **one** Resend
  message covering every unreported public submission. Rows are marked `notified_at` **only after
  a successful send**, so a failed run retries rather than losing submissions, and an item is never
  reported twice. Batched rather than per-row because a public endpoint that sends mail is a way to
  spend the studio's Resend quota.
- **History ↔ plan cross-link.** A release row now shows the CHANGELOG section that shares its
  version, joined on `normalizeVersion()` — the two sides disagree on punctuation (`## [3.2.0]` vs
  `v3.2.0`) and nothing enforces agreement, so joining the raw strings would report every release
  as undocumented. A **shipped** release with no CHANGELOG entry is flagged.

### Changed

- The cron secret check moved to `server/lib/cronAuth.ts`, shared by both scheduled routes. A
  secret check copied twice is a secret check that drifts, and the difference is usually the one
  that fails open. `src/test/bundleSafety.test.ts` now holds **both** routes to importing it.

### Notes

- ⚠️ **The drawer's `source_ref` link is read-only, and that is a deliberate deviation from the
  plan.** The roadmap asked for an editable link field; `buildPlanItemPatch` refuses the column
  because provenance is not an editable field, and it doubles as the item's idempotency key. The
  deviation is recorded in the roadmap and asserted by a test so it cannot be "fixed" silently.
- ⚠️ **The releases backfill ran as a genuine no-op** — `plan_items` was empty. It was then
  rehearsed against the live schema inside a rolled-back transaction: duplicate labels collapsed,
  untrimmed labels matched, non-version labels (`backlog`) became releases, `NULL`/blank were
  skipped, and a second run created no duplicates. It runs **once**, so an item filed *after* this
  release with a `target_release` label lands in the unfiled bucket showing its label.
- `plan_items.target_release` is **kept**. Dropping a column in the same migration that introduces
  its replacement removes the only way to audit the backfill afterwards.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-09-15

> **"Capture" — the studio feedback & planning board.** The first release of the studio feedback &
> planning program (`plan/ROADMAP_V3_1_TO_V3_3_FEEDBACK_AND_PLANNING.md`), which takes
> `v3.1.0`–`v3.3.0` and moves Phase 5 to `v3.4.0`. ⚠️ **The version and the date were set in the
> release PR, not after it.** The `v3.0.0` section below shipped still headed `[Unreleased]`, so the
> generated history screen rendered the entire v3 program as unreleased — a defect found only by
> building the thing that reads these documents back (see *Fixed*, below).

### Added

- **The studio feedback & planning board.** An admin menu for the studio to plan *itself*: file
  ideas, feature requests, bugs and tasks, triage them, and group them by a release label. New
  table `public.plan_items` (15 columns, 4 CHECK constraints, 3 indexes, RLS with one
  `is_admin_or_editor()` policy and **no public policy at all** — the table holds public
  submitters' email addresses), and a new `server/routes/plan.ts` with six endpoints behind two
  deliberately different doors:
  - `POST /api/plan/feedback` — **public**, no session. Accepts a title, a body and an optional
    email; the server forces `kind = 'suggestion'`, `source = 'public'` and `status = 'new'`.
  - `POST /api/plan/items` — `requireAuth`, any role. Accepts a staff `kind`; the server forces
    `source = 'studio'` and takes `author_id` from the session.
  - `GET`/`PATCH`/`DELETE /api/plan/items` and `GET /api/plan/history` — `requireAuth`, and
    `requireRole('editor')` for everything that touches the board.

  ⚠️ **`source`, `source_ref` and `author_id` are never read from a request body.** A caller that
  posts `{"source":"studio","kind":"bug","status":"done","source_ref":"artwork:hijack"}` to the
  public door still stores a `suggestion` from the public, with no author and no link. That rule is
  enforced in `server/lib/planRules.ts` and asserted against a live database, not just in a unit test.
- **The Changelog screen — the project's history, derived rather than authored.** `CHANGELOG.md` and
  `DEPLOYMENT_LOG.md` are parsed at build time by a new pure `scripts/lib/releaseLog.ts` into
  `src/data/releaseLog.generated.ts` (21 releases, 77 deployment rows, 224 entries, 0 parse
  warnings), served by
  `GET /api/plan/history` and rendered read-only at `#/admin/changelog`. Readable by **every** role.
  - The artifact is **deterministic — no timestamp** — so `npx tsx scripts/generate-release-log.ts &&
    git diff --exit-code` is a real staleness check, and `src/test/releaseLogSync.test.ts` **fails
    the suite** the moment the artifact and the two documents disagree. That is what makes "displayed
    as they change" a guarantee rather than a hope: a release that forgot to regenerate cannot merge.
  - It is served over HTTP rather than parsed in the browser, so the ~220 KB of history never enters
    the client bundle — the payload problem R-20 already recorded for `assetRegistry.ts`.
- **Two intake doors in the public footer.** *Feedback & Suggestions* for every visitor (it posts to
  the public endpoint), and *Request a Feature* / *Report a Bug* for signed-in users. One modal
  (`src/components/FeedbackModal.tsx`) serves all three. A `viewer` may file but cannot read the
  board — anyone may knock, only editors triage.
- **A Planning card on the studio dashboard** (open items, in progress, awaiting triage), shown only
  where the board is readable.
- **The board ships with 62 items on it.** `scripts/seed-plan-board.ts` files one review task per
  unpublished mural — `artworks.kind = 'mural' AND draft = true` — keyed on
  `source_ref = 'artwork:<slug>'` so re-running inserts nothing. It **prints NEW / EXISTS / COLLISION
  counts** rather than relying on a silent `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, because a silent conflict hides a
  wrong natural key. This is also the cheapest possible answer to Q17 ("how do the 60 unpublished
  murals get reviewed?"): a board that is empty is a board nobody opens.

### Changed

- **`POST /api/inquiries` is now guarded — it was the project's only public write, and it was
  unguarded.** `plan/BACKLOG_STUDIO_CMS.md` §1.3 recorded no captcha, no honeypot and no rate limit,
  while every accepted submission spends **two** Resend sends and lands in the studio's inbox. Rather
  than ship a second public endpoint next to a documented defect, both now use a shared helper
  (`server/lib/requestGuards.ts`): a hidden `company_website` honeypot and a sliding-window per-IP
  limit (5 per 30 min for inquiries, 20 per hour for feedback, keyed by account for the staff door).
  A tripped honeypot answers **201 with a plausible success** so a bot learns nothing.
- **The public write doors are capped at 64 KB.** A scoped body parser is mounted *before* the global
  50 MB one for `/api/inquiries`, `/api/plan/feedback` and `/api/plan/items`, so an oversized payload
  is refused before it is buffered. Both the JSON and the form-encoded parser are scoped — one
  without the other is a door left open.
- **`CmsUser` now carries the profile's name.** `resolveCmsUser` already selected `full_name` and
  threw it away; `plan_items.author_name` is denormalised on purpose, and a column that is null for
  every staff-filed item would be decorative.
- **The documentation this release invalidated was repaired in the same PR** (task 2 / Q-D):
  `AGENTS.md` header, §5 (16 migrations, `plan_items`, row counts), §6 (the new files, 13 → 16
  migrations) and §8 (the `minRole` ↔ guard matrix, the suite count);
  `docs/runbooks/database-backup-restore.md` (the `plan_items` restore-set row and §7's two ledger
  counts); `plan/README.md`; and `plan/BACKLOG_STUDIO_CMS.md` §1.3/§1.4. §8 also gained a **release
  checklist**, because three of its four items had been skipped at least once — the `AGENTS.md`
  header read `v2.13.0` through three releases, and the derived artifacts were regenerated *after*
  the release that needed them.

### Fixed

- **The `v3.0.0` CHANGELOG section was never closed.** It was still headed `[Unreleased]` with a
  blockquote reading *"Accumulating for `v3.0.0`"* — a month after the tag was cut — so the generated
  history screen rendered the entire v3 program as *unreleased*. Closed as `[3.0.0] - 2026-09-15`,
  pinned to the tag (`v3.0.0` → `dc4be84`) and the deployment row that records it. Found by building
  the history view, which is the first thing in this repository that reads these documents back.

### Security

- **`plan_items` has no public read policy, and must never gain one.** It stores the email addresses
  of anonymous members of the public. Proven rather than asserted: an anon PostgREST read of the
  table returns **zero rows** while 62 rows exist behind RLS, with an anon read of `artworks` as the
  positive control.
- **Body-parser failures are answered in JSON.** `entity.too.large` → 413 and `entity.parse.failed` →
  400, narrowly scoped so nothing else is swallowed.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-09-15

> **The v3 program, complete.** Delivered as a sequence of PRs — one per phase — with this section
> accumulating until the tag was cut on the merge commit that completed Phase 4. Annotated tag
> `v3.0.0` → `dc4be84`; the deployment row is in `DEPLOYMENT_LOG.md`. The objective was to **merge
> the two archived predecessor websites** (mural projects + fine art) into this app's Supabase
> catalog, and to do it without losing a row.
>
> ⚠️ **This section is the v3.0.0 record and is closed.** The blockquote that stood here until
> 2026-09-15 still read *"Accumulating for `v3.0.0`"*; the release had already shipped.

### Added

- **Phase 2 — addressability. Artworks now have real, crawlable URLs.** Every published artwork is
  served at `/artwork/<slug>`, prerendered to a static file per artwork at build time by
  `scripts/prerender-seo.ts`, with its own `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`,
  `<link rel="canonical">`, `og:*` and `twitter:*` tags **present in the HTML the server returns**
  rather than injected after hydration. `dist/sitemap.xml` enumerates every published artwork, and
  `public/robots.txt` now carries the `Sitemap:` line its own comment said to add when real routes
  shipped. The tags are built from the artwork's own columns — no templated marketing copy is
  invented for a catalog raisonné entry.
  - The prerender reads with the **anon key**, so the `artworks` RLS policy
    (`USING (trashed = false AND draft = false)`) makes publishing a draft *physically impossible*
    even if the filter were wrong; `selectIndexable()` is the second, testable gate, and it is
    asserted against fixtures containing both a draft and a trashed row.
  - A build that reads **zero** artworks, or zero *indexable* artworks, **aborts** — an empty
    sitemap that ships silently is the exact failure this phase exists to prevent.
  - A **loopback origin is refused.** `.env.local` sets `APP_URL=http://localhost:3000`, and a build
    that inherited it would have emitted `http://localhost:3000/artwork/...` as the canonical of
    every page — telling a crawler the real site is a duplicate of a URL on one laptop. Strictly
    worse than shipping no canonical, and invisible until search traffic disappeared.
- **Phase 0 — the object listing.** `verify-media-backup.ts` takes `--out <dir>` and writes
  `object-listing.json`: every object's path and size plus a sha256 over the canonical
  `path<TAB>size` lines. A database dump describes Storage objects but does not contain them, so
  this is the artefact that makes *"what did we actually have?"* answerable. First capture:
  **605 objects / 76.6 MiB**, sha256 `467757ce1bb1dd19…`, alongside the pre-Phase-4 dump.
- **The Storage story, written down** (`docs/runbooks/database-backup-restore.md` §2d). Storage is a
  *recovery-speed* risk, not a survival risk — Q1 says the assets are copies and the artist holds
  the originals. So: the periodic object listing, plus **`wayback/` as the second copy of every
  mural image** (they are derived from a committed immutable archive and can be re-rendered
  byte-identically). No bucket versioning, no second vendor.

- **Phase 4 — the load. The two archived predecessor sites are now in the catalog.** This is the
  first and only release that writes to Supabase, and the least reversible thing in the v3 program
  (**R-07**). Taken together, the four steps moved the database from **307 rows to 862**:

  | table | before | after |
  | :--- | ---: | ---: |
  | `artworks` | 138 | **205** |
  | `taxonomies` | 3 | **13** |
  | `artwork_terms` | 0 | **142** |
  | `media_assets` | 152 | **320** |
  | `artwork_images` | *(did not exist)* | **168** |

  - **Step 1 — the artwork rows.** 67 INSERTs (60 murals from the recovered WordPress export, 7
    paintings from the scrape) plus the 2 PRD_V3 §2 merges landing as `UPDATE`s on the live rows
    (`austin-postcard-mural` → `austin-postcard`, `marcia-ball-cd-cover` → `marcia-ball`), never as
    duplicate INSERTs. **Every one of the 60 new murals lands `draft = true AND enabled = false`**,
    so the load cannot publish anything the artist has not reviewed; the only anon-visible murals
    are the 2 that were already live.
  - **Step 2 — media registration.** 168 `media_assets` rows upserted, 0 failed, **no `original.*`
    object written** (Q4), 504 Storage objects. Registration writes `artwork_slug` only for a
    *trusted* match (`exact-slug` / `divergence-map` / `known-dedupe` — 3 of 168); the other 165
    register **unlinked on purpose**, because the artworks they belong to did not exist yet.
  - **Step 3 — linkage, and the `artwork_images` join (D3 / Q16).** 165 rows linked and **168 join
    rows** written, so every image of a multi-image mural is now addressable and its cover is
    explicit. 38 of 63 recovered artworks carry more than one image and the largest carries 21 — a
    single `image_url` column could not express them. The step **refuses rather than repairs**: an
    unknown artwork slug, a manifest id with no media row, or a row already linked to a *different*
    artwork aborts the run, because silently re-pointing one would move a photograph off a live
    artwork with nothing in the UI to say so. Verified afterwards: 168/168 manifest ids linked, 168
    join rows over exactly 61 artworks, **0 duplicate pairs, 0 orphans**, and a re-run plans **0**
    links.
  - **Step 4 — taxonomies and `artwork_terms` (D5 / Q6, R-09).** The 10 categories the export
    defines are filed as **two dimensions**, not one: 8 `project_type` (interior, business,
    exterior, restaurant, event, retail, signage, museum) and 2 `curation` (featured, home), so a
    mural filed under `interior` and `featured` is not put in two contradictory buckets. 142
    `artwork_terms` rows across 62 artworks. ⚠️ `artwork_terms` had been empty since the baseline,
    so this was the **first time the many-to-many path has ever run** — which is why the plan is a
    pure, tested module rather than inline SQL.
  - **D4 / Q18 — the year overwrite.** `artworks.year` held the hardcoded `'2024'` that
    `POST /api/artworks` defaults to, so the archive's `post_date` is authoritative for the mural
    rows and the correction is an **overwrite**, not a fill-only-empty pass. Shipped as its own
    reviewed migration with its own verified dump: `austin-postcard` `2024 → 2011`,
    `marcia-ball` `2024 → 2015`. Verified: **62 records, 62 agree with the archive, 0 disagree.**
  - **`artwork_images` is now part of the backup and restore set.** It was created by the Phase 4
    schema extension and immediately held 168 rows, but `scripts/lib/restorePlan.ts` did not list it
    — so the only recovery path (R-07: Free tier, no PITR, the repo dump *is* the backup) would have
    restored a catalog whose murals had lost their cover ordering. Found by reading the dump's own
    table list, not by a test. A dump now covers **9 tables**.

### Changed

- **Legacy `#/artwork/<slug>` links keep resolving.** A hash URL is not sent to the server, so the
  old form cannot be redirected with a server rule; the app rewrites it client-side with
  `history.replaceState` to the canonical path instead. A gallery's inbound links are its search
  equity — this is what keeps the release non-breaking (§3.3).
- **`Navbar`'s Dashboard link** wrote `#/admin` directly, which a stale `/artwork/<slug>` path would
  shadow; it now routes through the navigation callback like every other link.
- **"Copy share link"** on the artwork dossier emits the canonical path instead of a fragment.
- **An artwork's registry cover is now the *authored* one, not an alphabetical accident.**
  `scripts/generate-asset-registry.ts` built its key map by iterating `media_assets`
  `ORDER BY public_id` and letting the first row claim an `artwork_slug` key — so a mural's cover was
  "whichever of its images sorts first". It now orders by `artwork_images.position = 0` first, so the
  cover is the one the archive says it is. Regenerated: **457 → 1002 keys**, and the diff is exactly
  the **2 merge pairs** (`austin-postcard`, `marcia-ball`) taking their recovered-export cover.
- **`run-migrations.ts` now lets the operator's own choice win over `.env`.** `.env` sets the
  production `VRCL_SUPA_POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL` and that name is consulted *first*, while `dotenv`
  fills in any variable the operator did not export — so the runbook's documented scratch command,
  which exports only `VRCL_SUPA_POSTGRES_URL`, was **silently applying migrations to production**
  while the operator believed they were rehearsing locally (R-07's exact nightmare). An
  operator-exported variable now outranks the `.env` one; with nothing exported, behaviour is
  unchanged. Proven all three ways: `only VRCL_SUPA_POSTGRES_URL → 127.0.0.1 (local)`,
  `only PRISMA_URL → 127.0.0.1 (local)`, `no override → ⚠ REMOTE`.

### Fixed

- **⚠️ 604 of the 605 objects in `artwork-images` are cached for one hour, not a year.** Measured
  2026-09-15 from `storage.objects.metadata->>'cacheControl'`: 604 carry `max-age=3600`, one carries
  `max-age=31536000`. New uploads set the immutable year correctly, so this is the **Cloudinary-era
  migration**, which never set it. With no CDN (Q3), immutable browser caching *is* the egress
  strategy, and at one hour a returning visitor re-fetches up to ~8 MiB per full catalog browse
  against a 5 GB/month allowance. **Recorded, not yet remediated** — see `ROADMAP_V3.md` §4 and the
  runbook §6. It is deliberately **not** bundled into the v3.0.0 load: it rewrites 604 live objects,
  and spending a second bulk media rewrite in the same window as the largest one is precisely what
  the S1 ordering note warns against.
- **R-18 — `generate-asset-registry.ts` was silently first-wins.** A `public_id` equal to an existing
  artwork's slug **takes that artwork's registry key away**, and the live artwork then renders
  somebody else's photograph with no error anywhere. `findRegistryCollisions()` guarded the *write*
  of a new id, but nothing guarded *regeneration*. The generator now reports every key claimed by two
  **different artworks** and **refuses to write** while any exist (two images of the *same* artwork
  claiming that artwork's key is expected — the cover wins by construction). Measured against the
  live 320-row key space: **0 collisions.**
- **⚠️ 10 `media_assets` rows point at an `artwork_slug` that does not exist.** `media_assets` has
  **no foreign key** on `artwork_slug` (unlike `artwork_images`, which has one), so nothing ever
  caught it. They are near-misses rather than noise: `wisdom-cofee` → `wisdom-coffee`,
  `the-cats-of-the-colloseum` → `the-cats-of-the-colosseum`, and `kelzon-5` / `the-martian-2` /
  `regador-5` against `kelzon-v` / `the-martian-ii` / `regador-v` (roman-numeral vs digit). One more,
  `2010`, was baked into the *previous* committed registry as a key. **Recorded, not remediated**:
  adjudicating which near-miss is correct is an owner decision, and the archive does not cover the
  fine-art side. Also see the orphan note below.
- **136 artworks still carry the hardcoded `'2024'` year** — 116 paintings and 20 rows with
  `kind IS NULL`. D4's overwrite is scoped to the **mural** rows because the recovered archive is a
  mural source only; it carries no year for the fine-art side, and guessing would replace one wrong
  value with another. Recorded for a follow-up with a real data source.
- **`waybackLink.test.ts` asserted `missingMedia` in manifest order.** The plan reports it *sorted*,
  and lexicographically `'three'` precedes `'two'` (`h` < `w`). The test was wrong, not the code;
  corrected with the reason recorded so it cannot be "fixed" back.

### Fixed

- **`wayback-render.ts` recomputed the media plan instead of reusing the one it was given**, and the
  two stages therefore disagreed about a `public_id`. `buildMediaPlan` needs more than the reconciled
  records: `existingMediaByArtwork` (how many media rows an artwork already owns) decides whether an
  image gets `public_id = <slug>` or the suffixed `{slug}--{basename}` form. Rebuilding the plan from
  `records` alone silently *loses* that input, so an image landing on an artwork that already has
  media was planned as the bare slug — **the `public_id` its live row holds**. Measured:
  `business/marcia-ball-cd-cover` merges into live `marcia-ball`, so its image must be
  `marcia-ball--f-e1423423465404`; the renderer said plain `marcia-ball` and marked it `linkable`.
  Because `generate-asset-registry.ts` indexes **first-wins**, writing that would have taken a live
  artwork's registry key and made it render somebody else's photograph (**R-18**).
  `wayback-register.ts`'s live pre-flight caught it and refused — the guard working exactly as
  designed — but the correct plan already existed and the render stage was throwing it away. The
  renderer now prefers `extraction.mediaPlan`, falling back to recomputation only for sources that
  carry none.
- **`reconcile()`'s `shared-image` rule trusted `media_assets.artwork_slug`.** It matched
  `business/magazine-illustration-for-life-and-letters` to live `the-end-of-austin` at **confidence
  0.9** purely because a `media_assets` row declaring `public_id='b'` names that artwork — and **no
  artwork references `b.jpg`**. The declaration is unverifiable, so the rule now uses only the
  artwork's own `image_url`. Cost of the fix: **zero**; the scrape produced no such matches.
- **`byImageBasename` was indexed first-wins over a key that is not unique.** `artworks.image_url` is
  a filename reference, not an identity: **7 basenames cover 46 artworks**, and `r.jpg` alone is the
  `image_url` of **27**. A source image named `r` therefore matched whichever artwork came first in
  the snapshot — a deterministic wrong merge, invisible in a diff. The index is now built
  **unique-only**, so an ambiguous key matches nothing rather than matching the wrong thing.
- **`post_name` is percent-encoded, and reading it raw would have duplicated an artwork.**
  `motorcycle-mural-%e2%80%94-california-dreamin` decodes to exactly the scrape's
  `motorcycle-mural-—-california-dreamin`. Left encoded, the diff reports "one lost, one added" and a
  path-keyed merge creates a second record. No similarity measure can catch it — the strings are not
  *similar*, they are *identical modulo encoding*. `decodePostSlug()` now applies at both read sites.
- **`buildMediaPlan` counted only the siblings it was planning.** A single new image on an artwork
  that already had media was planned as `public_id = <slug>` — the key its existing row holds. This
  produced **2 R-18 collisions** on the recovered run; both are gone now that live media counts.
- **`tsconfig.json` had no `include`/`exclude`, so `npm run lint` failed outright.** `tsc --noEmit`
  was type-checking the gitignored export's **5,831 bundled WordPress plugin files** — ignore files
  do not affect compilers. Fixed with an `exclude`, which *overrides* the default, so `node_modules`
  and `dist` had to be re-listed.

### Added

- **`scripts/lib/wordpressDump.ts`** — a token-level reader for a real MariaDB dump (13.8 MB parsed
  in 77 ms, single pass). It **discards** insignificant whitespace between tokens rather than
  accumulating it; the first pass accumulated it, so `post_type` read as `' attachment'` and every
  attachment was filtered out of the corpus — a silent, total data loss. Pinned twice by test.
- **`scripts/lib/waybackRecovered.ts`** — extraction for the export, plus `toExtractedPages()`, the
  seam that lets the **unchanged** reconciler consume a second source. Also `lowestTermIdCategory()`,
  the WordPress permalink rule that reconstructs `category/slug` for a dump that stores no URL — it
  reproduces the scrape's path prefix for **60 of 60** shared posts, which is the only reason the two
  sources can be diffed row for row.
- **`scripts/lib/waybackDedupe.ts`** — duplicate detection over six independent signals
  (`known-pair`, `alias-match`, `near-miss`, `intra-source`, `shared-image`, `slug-clash`), and
  `applyDedupeMerges()`, which feeds the verdict back. ⚠️ Without that second function the detection
  is **inert**: the fuzzy matcher scores both PRD_V3 §2 dedupe pairs **below** its own 0.85 gate
  (0.833 and 0.710; **no** mural post scores ≥ 0.85), so both would classify NEW and insert two
  duplicate artworks (**R-01**).
- **`scripts/wayback-recovered-extract.ts`** — the read-only CLI that emits the diff report, the
  extraction JSON and the duplicate queue. `--extraction` / `--staging` were added to
  `wayback-render.ts` and `wayback-register.ts` so a second source flows through both unchanged;
  defaults are unchanged, so every existing invocation behaves exactly as before.
- **`applyBasenameFallback()` / `buildBasenameIndex()`** — recovery for an image whose declared upload
  path is wrong while its bytes are present. WordPress records the upload **month**, but
  `post_content` keeps the path written when the post was last edited, so the two diverge permanently
  across a month boundary. Exactly one reference is affected
  (`2010/03/good_morning_mural.jpg` → `_/2010/04/…`), and recovering it takes
  `unavailableCount` **1 → 0**. Candidates are a **list**, on purpose: two files sharing a basename
  is a real ambiguity, and it is **reported, never resolved**.
- **89 tests** (523 → **612**, across 37 → 39 files): `src/test/waybackRecovered.test.ts` and
  `src/test/waybackDedupe.test.ts`, including a regression block that pins the embedded-plan fix.

### Verified

- **Rendered:** 168 of 168 images, **0 failed**, 504 objects, **no `original.*`** (24 MB staging).
- **Register pre-flight:** 168 of 168 entries, **0 collisions in 152 registry rows**.
- **No-op proof:** after the library changes, re-running the existing scrape pipeline reproduced its
  artifacts with a diff of **exactly one line** (a timestamp) — the strongest available evidence that
  a shared-code change did not alter a live result.
- **Owner decision (Q5):** the duplicate review band is a **post-ingest cleanup list, not a write
  gate**. Possible duplicates are inserted as separate artworks and adjudicated by the artist in the
  studio dashboard; only the two *certain* PRD_V3 §2 pairs are merged, because inserting those is
  precisely the duplicate the requirement forbids.

## [2.16.0] - 2026-09-15

> **The media upload ladder, plus a dialog spacing fix.** No schema change, no new vendor, no CDN.
>
> Scope is **S2 only** from [`plan/PRD_V2_16_MEDIA_PIPELINE.md`](../plan/PRD_V2_16_MEDIA_PIPELINE.md)
> — that document's own §9 recommendation. **S1** (deleting the 151 unreferenced `original.*`
> masters), **S3** (`Cache-Control` audit of the 605 existing objects) and **S5** (measuring egress
> once) are **deferred to v3.0.0**. S1 is the only irreversible item in the PRD and the bucket is at
> 7.5 % of the free allowance, so nothing forces it now; S3 and S5 are housekeeping that v3 touches
> anyway. The PRD's other original items — WebP re-encode, CDN — were **removed outright** by the
> owner's answers and by its own §2 correction.

### Fixed

- **`POST /api/media/upload` gave admin uploads no thumbnail at all.** The insert was
  `VALUES ($1, $2, $2, …)`: one storage object, `url` and `thumbnail_url` set to the *same* string,
  `renditions` and `lqip` left null, and `width`/`height` taken from client form data. Any photo
  uploaded from the studio was therefore served at full size in the gallery grid, and the asset
  registry could never see it. One upload now renders `thumb` (640) + `hero` (1280) + `full` (2048)
  WebP plus a 20 px lqip placeholder, takes its dimensions and format from the **decoded** image
  rather than from the client, and registers all three in `media_assets.renditions` — so
  `url !== thumbnail_url` and `scripts/generate-asset-registry.ts` picks the upload up exactly like
  a migrated asset. The source bytes are deliberately **not** retained (PRD §1 Q4: full resolution
  is never needed in the studio; print-on-demand will source originals off-studio).
- **Modal headers could sit at a different inset from the content beneath them.** `DialogHeader` bled
  out to the dialog edge with `-m-6` and re-padded itself with `px-6 pt-6`, hard-coded against
  `DialogContent`'s `p-6` — two copies of one number that only agreed while nobody changed either.
  Any dialog that set its own padding (the inquiry modal's `sm:p-8`) left its title misaligned with
  the body. Both now read a single `--dialog-pad` custom property, so the header follows whatever
  padding the call site asks for, and a call site that wants more padding overrides the *variable*
  rather than competing with `p-*`. The bottom rhythm was also stacking `pb-4` on top of the
  container's `gap-4` (2rem) against 1.5rem above and beside the header; it is now one
  `--dialog-pad`, like every other gap in the dialog.

### Added

- **`server/lib/imageRenditions.ts`** — the rendition ladder, extracted from
  `scripts/migrate-cloudinary-to-supabase.ts` so the Cloudinary migration and the studio upload
  route share **one** encoder. Two encoders is how the migrated catalog and the studio's own uploads
  drift apart in quality, dimensions and object layout — and `{public_id}/{thumb,hero,full}.webp` is
  a contract, because `src/data/assetRegistry.ts` turns those paths into the URLs the public gallery
  renders. Renditions are never upscaled, so a small source still yields small renditions (which is
  why 79 of the 151 migrated assets have a `thumb` the same size as their `full`).
- **`server/lib/mediaUpload.ts`** — upload orchestration with its three side effects (storage upload,
  public URL, row insert) **injected**. That is what makes "three objects uploaded" and
  "`url !== thumbnail_url`" assertable offline; the old handler was unreachable to a test because
  nothing between `multer`, a live Supabase client and a live `pg` pool can be exercised in vitest.
- 29 tests: `src/test/imageRenditions.test.ts` (real sharp encodes — ladder widths, no upscaling,
  measured bytes, lqip, undecodable input), `src/test/mediaUpload.test.ts` (fake storage, real
  renders — object paths, `url !== thumbnail_url`, dimensions from the decoded image, and *nothing
  written* when the bytes are not an image), and the `dialog spacing contract` block in
  `src/components/ui/dialog.test.tsx`.

### Changed

- **`sharp` moved from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`.** It was a script-only dependency; the
  upload route now requires it inside the Vercel serverless function.
- `scripts/migrate-cloudinary-to-supabase.ts` imports the shared encoder instead of carrying its
  private copy. Behaviour is unchanged — verified by re-running `--dry-run`, which plans the same
  `w<=640/1280/2048 webp` objects — and its registry rows now carry dimensions measured from the
  encoded output rather than a ratio calculation.

### Notes

- Suite: **419 tests / 33 files** (was 390 / 31). `npm run lint`, `npm test` and `npm run smoke`
  (31/31 endpoints) all green.
- The upload route was **not** exercised against production: a live test would leave a real
  `media_assets` row and three objects in the bucket, and this repo has no delete path for storage
  objects. Behaviour is covered by the offline tests above.

---

## [2.15.0] - 2026-09-15

> **Close-out release.** No gallery-facing feature and no schema change. Every item is something
> the v2.13.0/v2.14.0 review passes left open: two documentation gaps on the backup cron, two
> files a public site is expected to have, and the housekeeping backlog.
>
> ⚠️ **This is not the `v2.15.0` described in `plan/PROMPT_V2_15_0_STORAGE_CDN.md`.** The storage
> and CDN hardening work (WebP re-encode, real rendition ladder, dropping the 151 unreferenced
> `original.*` masters, Cloudflare in front of Supabase Storage) is **deferred and unscheduled** —
> it was deliberately descoped by the owner to keep this release small. The version number is spent;
> that work will need `v2.16.0`. See `plan/README.md`.

### Added

- **`public/robots.txt`.** The site had no crawl policy at all. It allows the app shell and
  disallows `/api/`. **No `Sitemap:` line on purpose**: the gallery is hash-routed
  (`#/artwork/<slug>`), so individual artworks have no addressable URL for a crawler — a sitemap
  would list one URL and tell Google nothing. Per-artwork routes and a real `sitemap.xml` remain a
  v3.0.0 prerequisite.
- **`LICENSE` (MIT).** GitHub was reporting "no license", which blocks reuse and some corporate
  review. `README.md` previously *claimed* Apache-2.0 with no file present; the claim is now
  corrected to match. The license text carries an explicit scope note: it covers the **application
  code only** — the artwork and imagery remain © Rory Skagen, all rights reserved.
- **`scripts/delete-inquiries.ts`.** `#/admin → Inquiries` can only close an inquiry; there is no
  DELETE route anywhere in the server, so test rows were undeletable. This is the supported way to
  remove one. It is **read-only by default** — it resolves and prints every row before touching it,
  refuses anything that is not a UUID, deletes only the ids named, and re-reads afterwards to report
  what actually went. See `docs/runbooks/database-backup-restore.md` §4a for the rollback, which
  works because any dump's `inquiries.json` holds the full row.

### Fixed

- **The SPA catch-all rewrite swallowed `robots.txt`.** `vercel.json` rewrites every non-API path to
  `/index.html`, so a static file only survives if it is named in the negative lookahead. `robots`
  and `sitemap` are now excluded — the latter so that adding `sitemap.xml` in v3 does not need a
  config change to work.
- **The off-site backup verifier could not show which database a dump came from.**
  `scripts/verify-offsite-backup.ts` now prints `manifest.target` in both its human and `--json`
  output, so the A3 fix is checkable with the command that is already documented instead of needing
  a throwaway script.
- **`README.md` was stale in two places**: it claimed Apache-2.0 (now MIT, see above) and advertised
  the current release as `v2.9.0`.

### Changed

- **Deleted the two test inquiry rows from production** (`689daeb5-…` "Delivery Test (delete me)",
  `ea8c6344-…` "Persistence Test (delete me)"), both created while proving the mailer in v2.14.0. A
  verified dump was taken first: `data/backups/2026-09-15T00-31-27-111Z` (8 tables, 309 rows,
  self-verified). `public.inquiries` now holds 1 row.

### Documentation

- **B6 — the Hobby `maxDuration` ceiling is now recorded.** Hobby caps a function at 60 s (default
  10 s); `vercel.json` sets exactly 60, so the value is honoured and cannot be raised. Measured
  runtime is ~1.3 s, leaving ~45× headroom. Documented in
  `docs/runbooks/database-backup-restore.md` §2b. No code change.
- **B7 — `CRON_SECRET` scope confirmed and documented.** Verified via `vercel env ls`: the variable
  is a Secret in **Production only**, so `/api/cron/backup` returns **503** on Preview and
  Development deployments. That is intended — the route fails closed, and a preview deployment has
  no reason to consume the same 1 GB Hobby Blob allowance as the real nightly. Left as-is and
  written down, along with the one-line change to make if a preview URL ever needs to trigger it.

---

## [2.14.0] - 2026-09-14

> **Email reliability and backup follow-through.** One new additive migration
> (`2026_09_14_v2_13_1_inquiry_email_status.sql`); no change to the public gallery.
> Covers PRs #14, #15 and #16 — released together as one MINOR, because every item adds
> backwards-compatible functionality rather than only fixing defects.

### Fixed

- **Email: inquiry delivery is now awaited and reported truthfully.** `POST /api/inquiries` used to
  fire both Resend sends *after* `res.json()` and always answer `emailDispatched: true`. On Vercel the
  instance can be frozen once the response is flushed, so mail could be lost while the collector was
  told it had been sent. Both sends are now awaited (`Promise.allSettled`) and the response carries
  `email: { studio, collector }` with the real outcome. An inquiry is still stored and still returns
  `201` when mail fails — a mailer outage must not cost a lead.
- **Email: no environment separation.** Added `EMAIL_MODE` (`live` / `redirect` / `off`) and
  `EMAIL_REDIRECT_TO`, implemented once in the new `server/lib/emailRouting.ts`. A preview deployment
  can no longer email a real collector: recipients are replaced, the subject is prefixed `[PREVIEW]`,
  and a banner names who was originally addressed. `redirect` without a destination **suppresses**
  rather than falling back to the real recipient.
- **Email: hardcoded recipients.** Studio notifications now resolve from `ADMIN_EMAIL` + `STUDIO_CC`
  (`resolveStudioRecipients`); behaviour is unchanged when neither is set.
- **Email: public config leak.** `GET /api/email/status` published the studio's `adminEmail`. It now
  returns only `configured` / `domain` / `mode` / `apiKeyPresent`.
- **Cron: no way to tell a scheduled run from a manual one.** `GET /api/cron/backup` now logs the
  `user-agent` (`vercel-cron/1.0`) and `x-vercel-cron-schedule` header — relevant because Hobby keeps
  runtime logs for one hour.
- **Email: delivery outcome is now part of the record.** New additive migration
  `2026_09_14_v2_13_1_inquiry_email_status.sql` adds `inquiries.email_status`
  (`unknown|sent|partial|failed|suppressed|bounced`), `email_error`, `email_sent_at` and the two
  Resend message ids. A lost lead is now visible in `#/admin → Inquiries` instead of living only in
  Vercel's 1-hour log window. `suppressed` is deliberately distinct from `failed`.
- **Cron: scheduled runs are idempotent.** Vercel can deliver the same scheduled run more than once;
  a scheduled invocation now skips when a dump already exists for the current UTC day. Manual calls
  are never skipped, and `?force=true` overrides.

### Added

- **`POST /api/email/webhook`** — Resend delivery events. Verifies the Svix HMAC (constant-time,
  5-minute replay window) against `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and marks an inquiry `bounced` by message
  id. Implemented with `node:crypto` rather than adding an SDK, and mounted with `express.raw()`
  because the signature covers the raw body.
- **`scripts/verify-offsite-backup.ts`** — the project produced off-site backups it had no
  committed way to check. Newest / `--stamp <x>` / `--list` / `--max-age-hours <n>` / `--json`;
  exit 0 verified · 1 problems · 2 nothing to check. Requires a `manifest.json`, so a dump whose
  upload died halfway is reported rather than accepted as "the newest" (finding B5), and
  `--max-age-hours` turns "the nightly backup stopped running" into a non-zero exit instead of a
  silent gap — which matters because Hobby keeps runtime logs for one hour.
  Proven against the live store: 8 tables / 307 rows / 11 migrations / 406,593 B, `OK`, exit 0.
- `scripts/lib/offsiteBackup.ts` — pure dump-selection half, 11 new tests
  (`src/test/offsiteBackup.test.ts`).
- `server/lib/emailRouting.ts` — pure routing/recipient helpers, 16 new tests
  (`src/test/emailRouting.test.ts`); `src/test/offsiteBackup.test.ts` (11) and
  `src/test/emailReliability.test.ts` (13).
- [`docs/runbooks/email-delivery.md`](docs/runbooks/email-delivery.md) — two-mailer architecture,
  environment matrix, production go-live checklist, troubleshooting, and why Resend is the right
  long-term mailer.
- `EMAIL_MODE`, `EMAIL_REDIRECT_TO`, `STUDIO_CC` documented in `.env.example`.

### Fixed (v2.14.0 follow-ups)

- **The serverless smoke guard could not fail.** `scripts/smoke-serverless.ts` read
  `app._router.stack.filter((l) => l.route)`, and a layer only carries `.route` when it was
  registered with `app.get(...)`. Every router mounted with `app.use('/api/x', router)` was
  therefore invisible: the guard saw **5 of 31** endpoints, asserted a `POST /api/auth/login` route
  that does not exist, and called `process.exit(0)` unconditionally. It now walks mounted routers
  (recovering each mount path from the compiled matcher), asserts all 31 endpoints, exits **1** on
  any problem, and adds six live in-process probes. Proven by unmounting `/api/cron/backup`:
  reported missing *and* 404, exit 1. Available as `npm run smoke`.
- **Off-site dumps did not record where they came from.** `server/lib/catalogDump.ts` hardcoded
  `target: '(serverless)'` in the manifest, while the CLI script recorded the real host — so "which
  database is this?" (the first question during a restore) was unanswerable for every off-site dump.
  `describeTarget()` now lives in `scripts/lib/pgTarget.ts` and is used by both writers, and the
  cron route passes the live connection target with credentials stripped. A caller that supplies no
  target records `(unknown)` rather than a plausible-looking host.
- **An interrupted backup left debris that broke verification.** A stamp with objects but no
  `manifest.json` is an unfinished run: unrestorable, and while it is the newest thing in the store
  `scripts/verify-offsite-backup.ts` refuses everything, so a failed run looked like a dead backup
  for up to 14 days. `dumpsFromBlobs` now reports `hasManifest`, `planPrune` deletes such stamps once
  they are past a 24 h grace period (never the just-written one), and the route reports
  `incompleteDumps`.
- **An interrupted run suppressed the rest of the day's backups.** `hasDumpForDate` counted a
  half-uploaded stamp as "today is done", so a run that died would stop any later attempt that day
  and leave no restorable dump at all. Only a complete dump now satisfies a UTC day.

### Added (v2.14.0 follow-ups)

- `npm run smoke` — the rewritten serverless guard (above).
- `describeTarget()` in `scripts/lib/pgTarget.ts`, with tests asserting the password, user and
  scheme never reach the manifest.
- `incompleteStamps()` and `DEFAULT_INCOMPLETE_GRACE_HOURS` in `server/lib/blobBackup.ts`.
- `incompleteDumps` in the `GET /api/cron/backup` response, plus a `[cron/backup] incomplete
  dump(s)` warning so a partial run is visible instead of silent.
- **Suite: 390 tests / 31 files** (was 375 / 31 at PR #16; 335 / 28 at `v2.13.0`).
- `AGENTS.md` now records that `api/index.js` is a deliberately tracked build artifact
  (regenerated by `vercel.json`'s `buildCommand` on every deploy) and that `npm run smoke` is the
  way to check the live route table.

---

## [2.13.0] - 2026-09-14

> **Backup durability.** No schema change, no migration, and no change to the public gallery.
>
> The Supabase project is on the **Free plan: no automatic backups and no PITR** (verified
> 2026-09-14). The repo's logical dump was therefore the *only* recovery path this project had — and
> it existed on one laptop. This release makes that dump **verifiable**, **scheduled**, **off-site**
> and **pruned**, and closes the separate hole where the 605 image files in Storage were never
> compared against the rows describing them.
>
> It is a prerequisite for the v3 Wayback load, and deliberately its own release rather than scope
> added to `v2.12.0`.

### Added
- **Scheduled off-site dump.** `vercel.json` schedules one cron job → `GET /api/cron/backup`
  (`server/routes/cronBackup.ts`) → **Vercel Blob** under `catalog-backups/<stamp>/`. The route is
  gated on `CRON_SECRET` and returns **503 when the secret is unset** — it fails closed rather than
  open. Objects are written `access: 'private'`: a dump contains `profiles` emails and collector
  inquiries. The response carries metadata only, never row data.
- **`server/lib/catalogDump.ts`** — one in-memory dump builder shared by the CLI script and the cron
  route, because two writers of one backup format is how a backup stops being restorable.
- **`scripts/verify-backup.ts`** — re-check any dump: newest / a path / `--all` / `--json`.
  Exit **0** clean, **1** problems (do not restore from it), **2** nothing to check.
- **`scripts/verify-media-backup.ts`** — reconciles `media_assets` against the `artwork-images`
  bucket in **both** directions, read-only. Storage objects are the one thing a database restore
  cannot bring back, and nothing checked them before.
- Retention (`server/lib/blobBackup.ts`): keep 14 recent dumps, one per month for history, and
  never delete anything under 7 days old — so a run of bad dumps cannot wipe good ones. The dump
  written by the current run is never deleted, whatever the policy says.
- `src/test/bundleSafety.test.ts` — fails if a `scripts/lib/` module that runtime code depends on
  ever starts importing `pg`, `fs` or `dotenv`, which would pull them into the serverless bundle.

### Changed
- **`scripts/backup-catalog.ts` now emits manifest format v2** — a sha256, row count and byte length
  per table — and **self-verifies by re-reading the directory before exiting**, so a truncated or
  corrupted dump fails at creation instead of at restore.

### Fixed
- A v1 manifest is identified by the **absence** of `formatVersion`, not by `=== 1`. Every real v1
  dump on disk reports `undefined`, so the legacy branch was dead code and old dumps were reported
  as an unknown version instead of as *unverifiable but still restorable*. Found by running the
  verifier against the four dumps already in `data/backups/`.
- `stampToIso()` — a dump stamp (`2026-09-14T17-27-10-591Z`) is **not** a parseable date, and
  `selectForRetention` silently skips any dump whose `createdAt` fails to parse when applying its
  minimum-age floor. Feeding raw stamps in would have quietly disabled the one rule that stops bad
  dumps from deleting good ones.

### Verified
- **Against production, 2026-09-14** — `verify-media-backup.ts`: 152 rows ↔ 605 objects
  (76.6 MiB), **0 missing, 0 unexpected orphans, 0 size mismatches**. Detection proven, not
  assumed: replaying the real 152 rows against a perturbed object list yields `missing: 1` when one
  object is removed and `unreferenced: 1` when one stranger is added.
- 📌 **Finding: 151 `original.*` masters are unreferenced by design.** The Cloudinary migration
  stored `thumb`/`hero`/`full`/`original` per asset, but `media_assets.renditions` records only the
  first three. Those 151 files are the highest-resolution copies in the catalogue, no row points at
  them, and nothing in the app would notice if one vanished. Reported, not treated as a failure.
- Hobby-plan limits checked against `vercel.com/docs` rather than assumed: Blob includes
  **1 GB/month + 2,000 advanced ops**, and exceeding either **cuts off Blob access for 30 days**
  instead of billing — for a backup sink, a worse failure than an overage. One run is ~0.5 MB and
  ~10 advanced ops (`del()` is free). Hobby cron jobs may only run **once per day**.

### Notes
- `@vercel/blob` added (0 vulnerabilities reported at install). `package.json` version stays
  `0.0.0`; versions live in this file and in git tags.

---

## [2.12.1] - 2026-09-14

> **Security patch — no application code change.** Four Row Level Security policies granted full
> table access to *any* authenticated user, so the lowest `viewer` role could read **and write** the
> catalog, the media registry and the site pages, and read every collector inquiry, straight through
> PostgREST — bypassing the role matrix in `src/lib/roles.ts` entirely.
>
> **One database migration**, a policy *narrowing* only. No table, column, index, trigger or data
> change, and no client, server or API code touched. Baseline: `v2.12.0` (`f5cf64c`).

### Security
- **Four policies granted full table access to any authenticated user.** `artworks`, `media_assets`,
  `pages` and `inquiries` each carried a `FOR ALL TO authenticated` policy whose predicate was
  literally `true` — `"Admins full access to artworks"`, `"Admins full access to media assets"`,
  `"Admins full access to pages"`, `"Admins can view and manage inquiries"`. The names said
  *admins*; the predicates said *anyone who can log in*. `TO authenticated` is the Postgres role
  every Supabase session assumes and it carries no role claim, so a **`viewer`** — the lowest role in
  `src/lib/roles.ts` — could read and write every artwork, media asset and page, and read every
  inquiry, straight through PostgREST, bypassing the entire role matrix:

  ```
  GET    /rest/v1/inquiries?select=name,email,phone,message   -- every collector's details
  PATCH  /rest/v1/artworks?slug=eq.<any>                      -- edit any work
  DELETE /rest/v1/artworks?slug=eq.<any>                      -- delete any work
  ```

  The `inquiries` case was the worst of the four: collector name, email, phone and message are
  personal data the role matrix deliberately restricts to editor and above.

  `v2.12.0` recorded this as a **finding** against `artworks` alone. Enumerating the live policies
  showed the defect was in **four** places, and all four came from the same
  `2026_09_01_baseline_core_tables.sql`. Fixing two of four would have looked complete while leaving
  half the exposure — so this covers all four.

  **The fix is a completion, not an invention.** `2026_09_13_cms_v2_2_profiles_rls_recursion_fix.sql`
  already created and granted `public.is_admin_or_editor()`, and its own header says these helper
  policies should be "rewrite[n] against the definer helper so they cannot recurse either" — but the
  rewrite was never performed. The function was created, granted, and referenced by nothing. Each
  policy now uses `USING (public.is_admin_or_editor()) WITH CHECK (public.is_admin_or_editor())`,
  which mirrors the server guard exactly: all four routes are `requireRole("editor")`
  (`server/routes/artworks.ts`, `media.ts`, `pages.ts`, `inquiries.ts`), so the two layers finally
  agree. The helper is `SECURITY DEFINER` with `SET search_path = public`, which also avoids the
  `42P17` infinite-recursion trap this repo already hit once.

  It was never exploited — not because of a control, but because the app does not use that path.
  Verified before writing: every read and write in `src/` goes through `/api/*` (the only direct
  supabase-js table access in the client is `profiles`, in `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`), and the
  API is RLS-exempt because `query()` in `src/server/db.ts` opens a `pg` pool on the **owner**
  connection — no table here is `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`. As with the `v2.12.0` draft fix, that is
  a load-bearing accident, not a control.

  **Verified against a real database rather than argued.** The schema was built from
  `supabase/migrations/` into the local scratch database, seeded with one artwork, one inquiry, one
  media asset, one page and admin/editor/viewer profiles, then every policy was evaluated as each
  role (`SET LOCAL ROLE authenticated` + `request.jwt.claims`). With the old `USING (true)`
  predicate restored, a `viewer` passed **8 of 8** write probes; with the new predicate it is denied
  on **8 of 8**, while `admin` and `editor` are unaffected. A `viewer` can still read *published*
  artworks and pages — that is the `public` SELECT policy doing its job, since published work is
  public by design. A viewer also cannot self-promote: `profiles` has no UPDATE policy at all, so
  role changes can only go through `/api/admin/users` on the owner connection.
- **New regression guard — `src/test/migrationSafety.test.ts`.** Two tests now walk the migrations in
  apply order, keep only the *effective* final definition of each policy, and fail if any policy
  leaves `TO authenticated` with a `USING (true)` or `WITH CHECK (true)` predicate. A later migration
  that legitimately replaces a blanket policy is not flagged, so the guard judges the end state
  rather than the history. `TO public USING (true)` is deliberately allowed — anonymous read of
  published content and the public inquiry form are intended. The guard was **proven to fail**: with
  the fix removed it names all four offenders and the baseline that introduced them. Suite: 12 → 14
  tests in this file.

### Validation
- **Proven against production, not argued.** A temporary `viewer` account was created, signed in for
  a real session token, used to hit PostgREST directly, then deleted — the same standard applied to
  the `v2.12.0` draft fix:

  | probe as a real `viewer` session | result |
  | :--- | :--- |
  | `SELECT` artworks (published) | **138 rows** — public read intact |
  | `SELECT` inquiries (`name,email,phone,message`) | **0 rows** |
  | `SELECT` profiles | 1 row (own only) |
  | `UPDATE` artwork | **0 rows** |
  | `DELETE` artwork | **0 rows** |
  | `DELETE` inquiries | **0 rows** |
  | `INSERT` artwork | **blocked, `42501`** |
  | `UPDATE` own role → `admin` | **0 rows** — cannot self-promote |

  Cleanup verified: the auth user and its cascaded `profiles` row are gone, no probe rows remain,
  and the catalog is still at 138 artworks.
- **Proven on the local scratch database first.** With the old `USING (true)` predicate restored, a
  `viewer` passed **8 of 8** write probes; with the new predicate it is denied on **8 of 8**, while
  `admin` and `editor` are unaffected. A `viewer` can still read *published* artworks and pages —
  that is the `public` SELECT policy doing its job, since published work is public by design.
- `npm run lint` (`tsc --noEmit`) clean. `npm test` — **239/239 passing across 22 files** (was 237;
  the two new guards are included).
- Live introspection confirms the end state in production: all four policies now read
  `is_admin_or_editor()`, and the ledger is at **11 of 11**.

### Findings recorded (not fixed in this release)
- `artwork_terms`, `settings` and `taxonomies` are *correctly* scoped already, but via inline
  `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM profiles ...)` subqueries rather than the definer helper. They work, but
  they carry a subtle coupling to `profiles_select_own` that the helper does not. Left alone to keep
  this change minimal.

## [2.12.0] - 2026-09-14

> **Recoverability release — and the completion of [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-schema-as-code-before-data-migration.md)
> Phase A.** `v2.10.0` made the schema *reproducible*; this release makes it *recoverable*. The schema
> was dropped and rebuilt from `supabase/migrations/` alone into a virgin database, then introspected
> and diffed against production — **no structural differences remain** — and the restore path is now
> scripted, deterministic and rehearsed end-to-end. It also closes the draft leak in the `artworks`
> public read policy that `v2.10.0` and `v2.11.0` each recorded as an open finding.
>
> **One database migration** (`2026_09_14_v2_12_artworks_public_select_excludes_drafts.sql`) — a
> policy *narrowing* only. No table, column, index, trigger or data change. Baseline: `v2.11.0`
> (`5122812`).

### Added — Scripted Restore & Connection-Target Safety
- **`scripts/restore-catalog.ts` (new):** restores a `data/backups/<timestamp>/` snapshot through
  `psql`-free, parameterised inserts. Two modes with deliberately different semantics —
  `--mode load` (default) **never overwrites**, so it can only fill gaps and is safe to re-run;
  `--mode repair` upserts on conflict. Dry-run by default; `--apply` is required to write. Remote
  targets are refused unless `--allow-remote` is passed explicitly, `--tables`/`--all` scope the run,
  and `--best-effort` reports failures instead of aborting. It was exercised against the local
  scratch database before it was ever pointed at production (see **Validation**).
- **`scripts/lib/restorePlan.ts` (new):** the pure, offline-testable half of the restore path — the
  table list with each table's conflict target (primary key), the dependency-ordered
  `RESTORE_ORDER` (so foreign keys land in the right sequence), `CATALOG_TABLES` vs
  `ENVIRONMENT_TABLES`, the bindable-value coercion, statement construction, and failure
  summarisation. Kept free of `pg` and of the filesystem so it runs in the vitest suite with no
  network and no database.
- **`scripts/lib/pgTarget.ts` (new):** one shared rule for "is this connection string loopback or
  remote?", used by every script that opens a pool. Loopback (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`,
  `host.docker.internal`) connects with **no TLS** — which is what the local Postgres on `:54322`
  requires — while a remote target gets `{ rejectUnauthorized: false }`. Two parsing traps are
  handled explicitly and documented in the file: `new URL()` returns the IPv6 host **with** its
  brackets, so a bare `'::1'` comparison is dead code; and `postgresql:` is not a WHATWG "special
  scheme", so the host is not guaranteed to be lowercased.
- **Local Supabase dev stack (`supabase/config.toml`, `supabase/.gitignore`):** `supabase start` now
  brings up a throwaway Postgres on `127.0.0.1:54322` with REST/Studio beside it, so migrations and
  restores can be rehearsed against a real database instead of the live one. **CLI-managed migrations
  and seeding are disabled** (`[db.migrations] enabled = false`, `[db.seed] enabled = false`) — see
  the runbook for why this is not optional.
- **`.gitattributes` (new):** `*.sql text eol=lf`. See **Fixed** for the defect this prevents.

### Security
- **The `artworks` public SELECT policy no longer exposes drafts**
  (`supabase/migrations/2026_09_14_v2_12_artworks_public_select_excludes_drafts.sql`). The baseline
  policy was `USING (trashed = false)`, which filtered trashed rows but not drafts, so any holder of
  the anon key could read unpublished rows straight from PostgREST
  (`GET /rest/v1/artworks?select=slug,title,narrative&draft=eq.true`). It was never exploited only
  because the client reads through `GET /api/artworks`, which filters drafts server-side — a
  load-bearing accident, not a control. The predicate is now `trashed = false AND draft = false`.
  The server-side filter is **still required** and must not be removed: the API runs on the server's
  own connection, where RLS does not apply.
  **Verified against production rather than assumed.** The catalog currently holds zero drafts, which
  would make a naive "anon sees 0 drafts" check vacuous — it would have passed before the migration
  too. So a throwaway `draft = true` row was inserted, and with it present: the service role saw
  1 draft, `anon` saw **0** by both the `draft=eq.true` filter *and* a direct `slug=` fetch (the row
  has `trashed = false`, so the old predicate would have returned it), and `anon` still received all
  **138** published rows, proving public reads remain granted. The row was then deleted and the
  catalog confirmed back at 138 rows with 0 drafts.
- **RLS enabled on the migration ledger the runner creates.** `scripts/run-migrations.ts` created
  `public.schema_migrations` without row-level security, so on a rebuilt database the ledger was
  readable with the anon key. Production happened to have RLS enabled on that table already, which is
  exactly why no migration recorded it and why the static test set could never have caught it — the
  gap only appears on a *rebuild*. The runner now enables RLS immediately after the
  `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, making a from-scratch database match production.

### Fixed
- **Every database script hard-coded `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }`.** Against the local
  scratch database this failed with *"The server does not support SSL connections"*. All five
  scripts (`run-migrations`, `backup-catalog`, `restore-catalog`, `introspect-schema`,
  `generate-asset-registry`) now resolve TLS from the connection target via `scripts/lib/pgTarget.ts`.
- **Latent dead code in the loopback check.** The IPv6 branch could never match, because Node's URL
  parser returns `'[::1]'` rather than `'::1'`. Brackets are now stripped and the comparison is
  case-insensitive; both are locked down by tests.
- **`artworks` drafts could be reached by anon key** — see **Security**.
- **Backups were not deterministic.** `scripts/backup-catalog.ts` selected rows with no `ORDER BY`,
  so two consecutive dumps of an unchanged database were not byte-identical and could not be diffed.
  It now orders by each table's primary key, sourced from the single table spec in
  `scripts/lib/restorePlan.ts` (which also replaced a second, drifting copy of the table list), and
  it throws if a table has no recorded primary key rather than silently dumping unordered.
- **CRLF in migration files made "reproducible from version control" checkout-dependent.** Two of the
  ten migrations (`2026_09_12_cms_v1_profiles_roles.sql`, `2026_09_12_cms_v1_taxonomies_settings.sql`)
  carried CRLF in the working tree under the machine's global `core.autocrlf = true`. Because
  Postgres stores function bodies verbatim as returned by `pg_get_functiondef`, the CR bytes were
  written into the *stored* function source, so the same commit produced a different database on
  Windows and on Linux — and a rebuild diff showed 17 carriage returns where production had none.
  Their **committed** form was already LF, so no content rewrite was needed: `.gitattributes` pins
  `*.sql` to `eol=lf`, the two files were re-checked out, and a rebuild now reports **0 CR bytes
  across all 7 stored functions**.
- **The autosave batching test was load-dependent.** It drove four rapid keystrokes with
  `userEvent.type()`, which inserts real inter-key delays, so under parallel-suite load the debounce
  window closed mid-word and the test asserted an intermediate title. Rewritten with synchronous
  `fireEvent.change` plus an explicit `toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)` assertion, so it now verifies the
  property it was written for — four keystrokes produce exactly one save — rather than a timing race.
- **`testTimeout` raised to 15s** (`vitest.config.ts`). A full-suite run under load was observed
  taking ~25× its nominal duration in the environment phase, which pushed one real-timer
  `UsersAdminView` test past the 5s default. The raise is bounded and documented rather than
  open-ended, and is not a substitute for fixing genuinely slow tests.

### Docs
- **New runbook material — [`docs/runbooks/database-backup-restore.md`](docs/runbooks/database-backup-restore.md):**
  the plan tier is now recorded as **Free** (no platform backups, no PITR, projects pause after 7
  days of inactivity) with the consequences spelled out; §4a is marked **exercised**, including the
  rehearsal results and the `load` vs `repair` distinction; §6's known-gaps table was rebuilt from
  real statuses; **§7** documents the *two-ledger* problem; **§7a** records the empirical
  `supabase start` failure and its resolution; **§7b** is the scratch-database procedure.
- **`AGENTS.md`:** §4 documents that the runner creates and locks down `public.schema_migrations`,
  and adds the local scratch-database subsection (with the `config.toml` warning and the note that
  Docker Desktop installs per-user, so its `bin` is not on `PATH`); §5 records the Phase A
  verification, the gap it found, and the line-ending policy.
- **`plan/ROADMAP_V3.md` (new):** the `v3.0.0` program plan — six phases with exit criteria,
  dependencies and target release; a *justified* SemVer mapping; a risk register extending
  `PRD_V3` §6; a "do not do yet" list honouring ADR 0001 §5; and open questions separated from
  decisions. Indexed in `plan/README.md`.
- **`plan/BACKLOG_STUDIO_CMS.md` (new):** prioritised studio-CMS backlog written for a
  non-technical operator — manual catalog/hero ordering, undo & revision history, inquiry spam
  protection, per-artwork SEO, alt text, bulk actions, export, and inquiry follow-up. Every item was
  verified against the code and the live schema; nothing is scheduled. Indexed in `plan/README.md`
  as **Proposed**.
- **`DEPLOYMENT_LOG.md` reconciled.** It had drifted to its last row being `v2.8.0` (2026-09-12),
  omitting **seven production deployments** across `v2.9.0`, `v2.10.0` and `v2.11.0`, plus the PR
  preview deployments the release gate now depends on. Rows were reconstructed from the Vercel API
  (not invented), the stale `(Current Active)` marker moved to `v2.11.0`, the architecture milestones
  extended through Phases VI–VII, and a "Maintaining this log" section added with the query that
  rebuilds the table.
- **`AGENTS.md` §8 gains a Releases section** — the PR gate and its three checks (Vercel preview,
  Socket Security, Debricked), the "tag the merge commit on `main`" convention, the note that
  `v2.9.0` deviates, the rule not to prune a release branch unless asked, and the
  `DEPLOYMENT_LOG.md` obligation.

### Dependencies
- **Both moderate `qs` advisories resolved.** `express` moves `4.22.2 → 4.22.3`, which raises its
  `qs` range to `~6.16.0` (resolved `6.15.1 → 6.16.0`; `body-parser` dedupes to the same copy) and
  `path-to-regexp` to `~0.1.13`. Transitive only — no direct dependency and no `package.json` change.
  This clears the two Dependabot alerts that had been open since `v2.10.0`.

### Validation
- `npm run lint` (`tsc --noEmit`) clean. `npm test` — **237/237 passing across 22 files**, offline
  and zero-token, green on two consecutive full runs. Two new suites (+38 tests): `restorePlan` (27)
  and `pgTarget` (11). **Suite: 199 → 237 tests, 20 → 22 files.**
- **Phase A verified by destruction and rebuild.** Every `public` table was dropped and the schema
  recreated from `supabase/migrations/` alone — **10 of 10 migrations applied to a virgin database**.
  Introspection then showed no structural differences against production: 9 tables with all columns,
  types, defaults and constraints; 11 indexes; 20 policies; both `artworks` guard triggers; 7
  functions; 9 RLS flags. The only residual diffs were the four expected ones (ledger rows, and
  identifiers that differ by construction). This is what promoted Phase A from "believed" to
  "verified" and what unblocks `v3.0.0`.
- **The restore path was rehearsed end-to-end**, not merely unit-tested: plan mode wrote nothing;
  `--apply` inserted **294 rows, skipped 4, failed 0**; an immediate re-run inserted **0, skipped
  298, failed 0**, confirming idempotence; and a re-dump compared **5 of 6 tables byte-identical**,
  with `pages` differing only in `updated_at`. The 4 skips were all `pages` rows seeded by a
  migration — `load` correctly refuses to overwrite them, and `repair` is the mode that would.
- The two new suites run with no database and no network, which is what makes the write path
  testable at all; `server/` and `scripts/` still have almost no coverage, and the migration/write
  path remains the highest-consequence untested code in the repo.

### Findings recorded (not fixed in this release)
- **The sibling policy `"Admins full access to artworks"` is declared `FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (true) WITH CHECK (true)`.** The name says *admins*; the predicate says *any authenticated
  user*, so a `viewer` can read and write every artwork through PostgREST, bypassing the role matrix
  in `src/lib/roles.ts`. Scoping it to the real role claim is a larger change with a real blast
  radius and is deliberately not bundled here (ROADMAP_V3 §9 Q8 / risk R-06).
- **Storage objects are outside the backup scope.** `scripts/backup-catalog.ts` captures table rows
  only; the `artwork-images` bucket is not covered, and Supabase's own backups exclude Storage
  objects on every tier. Off-site durability for the image binaries is a separate, unscheduled work
  item.
- **The database password has not been rotated** — deliberately deferred by the owner to the `v3.0.0`
  cycle.
- Still open from `v2.10.0`: **no `LICENSE` file** (the README claims Apache-2.0 and now flags the
  gap), `artwork_terms` is empty, and there is no Supabase MCP server configured in this repo.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-09-14

> **Studio-operations release.** The Users screen becomes a real staff-management console (edit,
> invite, re-invite, reset), every studio email becomes branded, the public artwork dossier stops
> duplicating itself and the Scale & Proportions drawing becomes a true-to-scale elevation. Baseline:
> `v2.10.0` (`962587e`).
>
> **No database migration and no schema change.** The one API-shape change is additive; the only
> behavioural changes are the role gates, which *narrow* what a non-admin sees.

### Added — Studio User Administration
- **User editing (`PATCH /api/admin/users/:id`):** an administrator can now change a staff member's
  display name, email address, role and active state. Validated by `buildUserPatch()`
  (`server/lib/userAdmin.ts`); best-effort notification emails fire on role/access/email change.
- **Invite + re-invite:** `POST /api/admin/users/invite` mints an invitation; `POST /:id/reinvite`
  re-sends to a still-pending user (returns `409` if the address is already confirmed). For a user
  who has never signed in, the stale `auth.users` row is replaced first so re-invites are
  deterministic rather than stacking duplicate accounts.
- **Admin-issued password reset (`POST /:id/reset-password`):** mints a Supabase recovery link and
  delivers it through the studio's own branded mailer, returning the URL so an administrator can also
  hand it over manually.
- **Users screen rebuilt (`src/components/admin/UsersAdminView.tsx`):** search, pending-invite count,
  a "What each role can do" legend, an edit dialog, a delivery-result dialog with a copy-link field,
  resend-invite / send-password-reset row actions, empty state and success flash.
- **Branded email layer (`server/emailTemplates.ts`):** one table-based, inline-styled shell — brand
  mark, wordmark, gold rule, footer — shared by every studio message. Renders invite, password reset,
  access-changed, email-changed and test emails. `BRAND`, `resolveSiteUrl()` and
  `resolveBrandLogoUrl()` centralise the identity so nothing is hard-coded per template.
- **Supabase Auth mailer templates (`supabase/email-templates/`, `scripts/generate-auth-email-templates.ts`):**
  the six dashboard-only Supabase auth emails (invite, confirm sign-up, magic link, change email,
  reset password, reauthentication) generated from the same brand shell, plus a `manifest.json`
  mapping each file to its dashboard slot and subject. Run
  `npx tsx scripts/generate-auth-email-templates.ts` to regenerate.
- **Password-setup screen (`src/components/admin/PasswordSetupView.tsx`, `#/admin/set-password`):**
  the landing screen for invite and recovery sessions — new password + confirmation, reveal toggle,
  minimum length, and an explicit "this link has expired or already been used" state. Replaces the
  previously dead `#/admin/reset` route.
- **Shared role vocabulary (`src/lib/roles.ts`):** `CmsRole`, `CMS_ROLES`, `ROLE_ORDER`,
  `ROLE_LABELS`, `ROLE_DESCRIPTIONS`, `roleAtLeast()`, `normalizeRole()`, `roleLabel()`. Dependency-
  free so the browser bundle and the server share one definition instead of drifting.

### Changed — Catalog Administration
- **"Edit in Studio" now opens that entry's editor.** It previously dropped the curator on the full
  catalog list. `buildEditPath(slug)` produces `/admin/catalog?edit=<slug>`; `parseAdminPath()` reads
  it back and `AdminApp` deep-links straight into the artwork dialog for that slug
  (`src/lib/adminRoute.ts`).
- **The entry description is promoted into the info card.** The stored `narrative` is the full
  Obsidian source document — index link, H1, image embed, blockquote spec, then prose — and rendering
  it verbatim repeated the title and the hero image that are already on screen.
  `parseArtworkNarrative()` (`src/lib/narrative.ts`) now splits it into `description`, `metaLines`,
  `notes` and the untouched `markdown`; the description appears near the top and the original document
  moves behind a collapsed **Catalog Record** panel.
- **Duplicate media removed from the dossier.** The `.md` caption and the redundant Drive-record tab
  are gone; the physical size is shown instead, sourced from `formatDimensions()`.
- **Scale & Proportions rewritten as a true-to-scale elevation (`src/components/ScaleVisualizer.tsx`).**
  The old drawing was decorative and not proportional. The SVG is now drawn at **1 unit = 1 inch**
  (`viewBox="0 0 ${wallW} ${wallH}"`) with a 10 ft reference wall, a museum-standard 57″ centre line,
  a 5′ 10″ human figure and a 6 ft bench, plus dimension lines. Artwork rectangles carry
  `data-artwork-frame` / `data-width-in` / `data-height-in` so the proportions are assertable in
  tests. When no dimensions are recorded it says so instead of drawing a guess; a staff-only
  `showDataWarning` flag flags an aspect ratio that disagrees with the photograph by more than 15%.
- **Role-gated studio UI.** `ADMIN_NAV` items carry a `minRole` (`Inquiries`, `Media`, `Taxonomies`,
  `Design`, `Trash` → editor; `Users`, `Settings` → admin) and are filtered by `roleAtLeast()`. The
  matching routes render a `Forbidden` panel naming the required role, and every artwork mutation in
  `App.tsx` is gated behind `canManageCatalog` (admin or editor). Previously a Viewer was offered menu
  items that answered `403`.

### Fixed
- **Silent session drop on invite and reset links.** The app is a hash-router SPA and `supabase-js`
  reads the session out of the URL *fragment* and then blanks `window.location.hash` during its own
  async init — so by the time React mounted, the `type` that says "set a password first" was gone.
  Two changes fix it: the auth hand-off `type` is captured at module load in
  `src/lib/authRedirect.ts` (imported **first** in `src/main.tsx`, before the client is constructed),
  and `redirectTo` is now a **bare origin** with no `#` (`bareOrigin()` / `buildAuthRedirect()`).
- **Studio lockout is now impossible from the UI.** `decideMutation()` refuses self-role-change,
  self-deactivate and self-delete, and protects the last remaining active administrator from being
  demoted, deactivated or deleted by anyone. The Users screen mirrors the same guards by disabling the
  controls, and surfaces the server's `409` reason when a mutation is refused.
- **`UsersAdminView` imported role copy from a server module**, which risked pulling server code into
  the client bundle. Both sides now read `src/lib/roles.ts`.

### Docs
- **New runbook — [`docs/runbooks/supabase-email-branding.md`](docs/runbooks/supabase-email-branding.md):**
  documents the **two-mailer architecture** (studio-owned Resend vs dashboard-only Supabase Auth),
  the Resend env vars, paste-in steps for the six templates, SMTP sender setup, the redirect
  allow-list warning about `#`, known limitations and a verification checklist.
- **`AGENTS.md`:** §2 records the two-mailer model and the branded-template pipeline; §6 adds
  `server/lib/`, `supabase/email-templates/` and the new `src/lib/` modules; §8 adds the role matrix
  and the bare-origin redirect rule.

### Validation
- `npm run lint` (`tsc --noEmit`) clean. `npm test` — **199/199 passing across 20 files**, offline and
  zero-token. Nine new suites (+112 tests): `userAdmin` (29), `narrative` (13), `dimensions` (13),
  `emailTemplates` (13), `authRedirect` (10), `adminRoute` (9), `ArtworkFocusView` (9),
  `UsersAdminView` (8), `ScaleVisualizer` (8). **Suite: 87 → 199 tests.**
- The proportional-integrity tests read the artwork frame's `data-width-in`, so true scale is asserted
  numerically — `12"` renders width 12, `96"` renders width 96, and `3.5ft` resolves to 42.

### Findings recorded (not fixed in this release)
- **The `artworks` public SELECT policy still does not exclude drafts** (`USING (trashed = false)`).
  Unchanged from `v2.10.0` and still not exploitable, because the client reads through `/api/artworks`,
  which filters drafts server-side. Tightening the policy remains a tracked follow-up.

## [2.10.0] - 2026-09-14

> **Phase A of [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-schema-as-code-before-data-migration.md)** — the blocking
> prerequisite set for the v3 data migration. The database becomes reproducible from version
> control, a rollback path exists, and the migration runner's highest-consequence decisions gain
> test coverage. Baseline: `v2.9.0` (`de294d0`).
>
> **No runtime, API, or UI changes.** The one schema-touching artifact is written to be a verified
> no-op against the live database.

### Added — Reproducible Schema
- **Baseline schema migration (`supabase/migrations/2026_09_01_baseline_core_tables.sql`):** the four
  core domain tables — `artworks`, `media_assets`, `pages`, `inquiries` — were created directly in
  the Supabase project and were **never `CREATE`d anywhere in the repo**; every other migration only
  `ALTER`ed them. This baseline captures them with all indexes, `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, and every
  RLS policy. It is dated `2026_09_01` so the runner's lexicographic ordering applies it **before**
  the `2026_09_12+` migrations that depend on it, and is `IF NOT EXISTS` /
  `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` throughout so it is a no-op against the existing database. Without it,
  `run-migrations.ts` failed on a fresh project at the first `ALTER TABLE public.artworks`.
- **Live schema introspection (`scripts/introspect-schema.ts`):** read-only dump of the `public`
  schema — tables, columns, constraints, indexes, triggers, functions, RLS status, policies, row
  counts, and the applied-migration ledger — written to `data/archive/schema_introspection.md`. The
  baseline migration above is derived from this output rather than from the stale superseded draft.
- **Catalog backup (`scripts/backup-catalog.ts`):** strictly read-only (`SELECT`-only) per-table JSON
  snapshot of all 8 `public` tables plus a self-describing `manifest.json` (row counts, byte sizes,
  target, Postgres version, recorded migrations). Output lands in the gitignored `data/backups/`.
- **Backup & restore runbook (`docs/runbooks/database-backup-restore.md`):** the rollback path ADR
  0001 found missing — Supabase platform backup tiers and retention, the PITR add-on, both restore
  procedures, a pre-migration checklist, and an explicit list of known gaps.
- **Write-path test coverage (`src/test/migrationPlan.test.ts`, `src/test/migrationSafety.test.ts`):**
  23 new tests. `migrationPlan` locks down the runner's ordering and skip-if-tracked decisions;
  `migrationSafety` asserts the idempotency and reproducibility invariants across every migration
  file — including the invariant that would have caught this release's core bug: *RLS may only be
  enabled on tables that some migration actually creates.* **Suite: 64 → 87 tests.**

### Changed
- **Migration runner refactor (`scripts/run-migrations.ts`):** the pure ordering/skip logic moved to
  `scripts/lib/migrationPlan.ts` so it is unit-testable offline — the runner previously had zero
  coverage because it opens a `pg` Pool at import. It now reads the `schema_migrations` ledger once
  instead of per file. **Behaviour is unchanged**, including all console output.

### Fixed — Documentation Accuracy
- **ADR 0001 contained two unverified claims**, caught by re-reading the code against the live
  introspection and corrected: the superseded draft's `CREATE TABLE` was said to use a column name
  the code no longer uses (`series`), but `gallery_series` is in fact correct in both the live
  database and `src/`; and `sort_order` was attributed to `artworks` when it belongs to `taxonomies`.
  The stale doc's real defect is narrower and now stated precisely: it is missing exactly one column
  (`draft`), every index, and all RLS objects.

### Docs
- **`AGENTS.md`:** §5 now records that the schema *is* reproducible (replacing the warning that it was
  not), documents the new **ledger drift** finding, and corrects row counts to verified live values
  (`profiles` 2 → 3; `inquiries`/`settings`/`taxonomies` added; `artwork_terms` is **empty**). §4
  documents the introspection and backup commands; §6 adds `docs/runbooks/`, `scripts/lib/`, and
  `src/test/`; §8 adds the baseline-ordering and back-up-before-you-write rules.
- **`plan/PRD_V3_WAYBACK_DATA_MIGRATION.md`:** all three §0 blocking prerequisites ticked with
  evidence; status advanced to *prerequisites satisfied, ready for read-only Steps 0–4*.
- **`.gitignore`:** `data/backups/` ignored — logical dumps contain production data and studio
  member email addresses, and must never be committed.

### Findings recorded (not fixed in this release)
- **The `artworks` public SELECT policy does not exclude drafts.** `USING (trashed = false)` would
  expose draft rows to any holder of the anon key. It is not currently exploitable because the client
  reads through the server API (`/api/artworks`), which filters drafts — but the policy is one
  direct-PostgREST query away from leaking unpublished work. Deferred to the Phase A follow-up rather
  than changed silently here.
- **Storage objects are not covered by database backups** (Supabase backs up metadata only), and the
  project's plan tier — which determines whether automatic backups exist at all — is unverified.
  Tracked in the runbook's known-gaps table.

### Validation
- `npm run lint` (`tsc --noEmit`) clean. `npm test` — **87/87 passing across 11 files**, offline.
- **Baseline migration proven to be a production no-op.** A read-only catalog backup was taken first
  (`scripts/backup-catalog.ts` — 8 tables, 306 rows), the migration was applied to the live database,
  and the schema was re-introspected and diffed against the pre-change report. The **only** deltas
  were the migration's own ledger row and the report's generation timestamp — no column, index,
  trigger, function, RLS, or policy difference.
- **Ledger drift reconciled.** Re-running the runner then applied the two previously out-of-band
  migrations and recorded them, so `public.schema_migrations` now holds **9 of 9** files. The same
  introspection diff confirmed those re-applications changed nothing but the ledger — the drift was
  bookkeeping, not schema.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-09-13

> **Delivered by commits:** `406def2` (Cloudinary residue cleanup, Supabase RLS hardening, server
> modularization) · `a43fe40` (artwork drafts, autosave, shadcn/ui primitives, test suite) ·
> `8e14fda` (full-bleed home hero, profiles RLS 500 fix) · docs reconciliation (this release).
> Baseline: `v2.8.0` (`411138a`).

### Added — Home Hero Rework & Profiles RLS Fix
- **Full-Bleed Hero Backdrop Slider:** The home masthead now overlays a single full-bleed artwork slider — the active piece cover-crops the entire canvas (no letterboxing for any aspect ratio), blurred and brightness-tuned per theme with a slow settle animation. The artwork meta card is gone; the only chrome is hover ghost-arrows, an interior active-slide name pill beside progress dots (bottom-right), and pause/play. `PageHeader` remains the standard header for all other public pages (the transient `bleed`/`inset` experiment was reverted).
- **Uniform Section Rhythm:** Sections below the hero live in one inset content frame whose `space-y` owns the vertical spacing — measured 64px between every section, fixing the padding gaps introduced by earlier full-width edits.
- **Profiles RLS Recursion Fix (migration `2026_09_13_cms_v2_2_profiles_rls_recursion_fix.sql`):** `profiles_select_admin` subqueried `public.profiles` inside a policy on `profiles`, so every client profile lookup aborted with Postgres 42P17 ("infinite recursion detected in policy") and PostgREST returned HTTP 500 on session refresh. The admin/editor checks moved into `SECURITY DEFINER` helper functions (`is_admin()`, `is_admin_or_editor()`); profile queries now return 200.
### Added — Draft Workflow, Auto-Save & Sticky Modals (PRD Phase 3+, per `docs/PRD.md`)
- **Artwork Drafts:** New `draft` column (migration `2026_09_13_cms_v2_1_artwork_drafts.sql`) with partial indexes and a DB trigger enforcing that a draft can never be publicly enabled. Save-as-draft / Publish in the artwork editor, Draft badge, Drafts filter tab with count, Publish/Unpublish row-menu actions, and a dashboard Drafts stat.
- **Draft Privacy End to End:** Anonymous API reads never receive draft rows (list filter + per-slug 404); the state engine gates drafts at its single `rowToRecord` choke point (`enabled=false`), so hero, gallery, catalog counts, and slug lookups all exclude them with no per-view special cases.
- **Draft Auto-Save:** Persisted drafts save automatically ~1.2 s after typing pauses (snapshot-diffed, keystrokes batched); live status indicator (Unsaved… / Saving… / ✓ Saved / Save failed); closing the dialog flushes unsaved draft edits; create mode requires an explicit first Save-as-draft; published works are never silently auto-saved.
- **Sticky Modal Headers:** `DialogHeader` is now sticky inside the scrolling `DialogContent` across all modals — titles and the close X stay pinned while long forms scroll.
- **Actions at the Top of CRUD Modals:** Action buttons relocated from the bottom footer into the sticky header row of every admin modal — artwork editor (Cancel / Save draft / Publish·Save changes, with the autosave indicator), trash & permanent-delete confirms, user delete-confirm and invite, taxonomy delete-confirm and create, and both page dialogs. Primary buttons submit via `requestSubmit()` so keyboard and pointer share one path.
- **Zero-Token Tests for Drafts & Autosave:** 11 new contracts covering the draft lifecycle (hidden publicly, badge, publish/unpublish fire once), autosave debouncing/batching/gating, close-flush, and sticky-header rendering. Suite total as of this release: **64 tests across 9 files** (`npm test`, offline).
### Fixed
- **Unsaved-Changes Protection:** Closing a dirty non-draft edit (X, Cancel, Esc, overlay) now asks "Discard unsaved changes?" instead of silently dropping edits; drafts flush automatically; `beforeunload` covers browser/tab closes; in-app navigation reporting via `onDirtyChange`.
- **Form-Reset Race:** The artwork editor's form previously reset whenever the engine refreshed (new record object identity), wiping in-progress edits; reset is now keyed on dialog-open/slug change only.
- **Duplicate Drafts on Create:** Creating a draft then continuing to type POSTed again on save; the dialog now switches to PATCH the created record (server returns the slug; engine refresh precedes the switch).
- **Catalog Row-Click View:** Clicking anywhere on a data row opens the artwork dossier; `navigateTo` gained the missing `/artwork/<slug>` branch (previously both row-click and the View menu item were silent no-ops); row-interior switches/menus no longer double-fire.
- **Modal (X) Close Button:** Now wired to `onOpenChange` via Radix context — previously dispatched a `dialog-close-request` CustomEvent that nothing in the codebase handled, so the button was guaranteed dead.
- **Modal Scroll on Short Viewports:** Dialog content owns `max-h` + `overflow-y-auto` (upstream pattern), ending the flex-centering top-clipping geometry; per-call-site `max-h-[85vh]` patches removed from `ArtworkEditDialog` and `PagesAdminView`.
- **Row Action (Dot) Menus:** Radix portal rendering with collision detection ends menu clipping inside the table's overflow container (the real mechanism behind "menu choices don't work"); items now carry `menu`/`menuitem` roles, arrow-key navigation, typeahead, and Esc/outside dismiss with focus restore.
- **Unconfirmed Trash:** "Move to trash" now routes through a confirmation dialog (matching permanent delete) instead of deleting immediately.
- **Native Browser Dialogs:** `window.confirm`/`alert` in Users and Taxonomies admin views replaced with standard themed confirm Dialogs; no native dialogs remain in `src/`.
- **InquiryModal Stale State:** Reopening after a submit showed the "Message Sent" screen instead of the form; transient state now resets on open.
### Changed
- **shadcn/ui Registry Adoption:** `ui/dialog`, `ui/dropdown-menu`, `ui/switch`, and `ui/label` regenerated from the official Tailwind v4 registry source on Radix — replacing the hand-rolled imitations; public API of call sites kept (additive `variant`/`onSelect` migration).
- **Bespoke Overlays Retired:** `ArtworkQuickViewModal` and `InquiryModal` migrated onto the shared `ui/Dialog` (portal, focus trap, scroll lock, working close); designs preserved and hardcoded hex colors tokenized.
- **Dropdown API Canonicalized:** Call sites (`CatalogView`, `UsersAdminView`) migrated from the custom `trigger` prop to `DropdownMenuTrigger asChild` + `DropdownMenuContent`, with `onSelect` handlers and per-row `aria-label`s.

### Docs — Documentation & Context Reconciliation
- **`AGENTS.md` (new):** single verified project-context document — authoritative stack, env var
  names, DB write path, post-migration schema, and guardrails — so future contributors and agents
  stop re-deriving state from contradictory specs.
- **`plan/README.md` (new):** status index for every specification (Implemented / Superseded / Planned).
- **Spec status corrections:** `plan/PRD_V2.9_CLEANUP_AND_OPTIMIZATION.md` marked **Implemented** with
  a per-subsystem delivery map; `plan/PRD_V2.1_CLOUDINARY_EXIT.md` marked **Implemented** with a
  delivery record; `plan/DRAFT_FEATURE_PULL_REQUEST.md` marked **Superseded** (Cloudinary-era
  assumptions).
- **`plan/PRD_V3_WAYBACK_DATA_MIGRATION.md` (new):** the v3 plan for merging both archived
  predecessor sites into the Supabase catalog + media library.
- **`README.md` reconciliation:** removed the obsolete Cloudinary badge, endpoint row, and env vars
  (including the legacy `CLOUDINARY_URL` line); corrected React 18→19 and Tailwind 3→4 badges; env
  block now matches `.env.example` (`VRCL_SUPA_*`); migration list completed to 8/8; directory tree
  refreshed; `/plan` links repaired; corrected the serverless entrypoint name to `api/index.js` and
  re-scoped the payload-limit note off the retired vendor.
- **Housekeeping:** quarantined the unimported `src/data/portfolioPostsData.updated.json` to
  `data/archive/` (provenance only; no importers — verified by repo-wide search).
- **Validation:** `npm run lint` (`tsc --noEmit`) clean; `npm test` — **64/64 passing across 9 files**;
  all internal documentation links verified to resolve (two pre-existing README links repaired:
  `/plan/FEATURE_PULL_REQUEST.md` → `plan/DRAFT_FEATURE_PULL_REQUEST.md`, and a `LICENSE` link with
  no target file). Documentation-only release: no runtime, schema, or API changes.

### Chore — Repository Hygiene & Decision Records
- **Package renamed off the scaffold name:** `"react-example"` → `"roryskagenart"` in `package.json`
  and `package-lock.json` (both the root and `packages[""]` entries, so `npm ci` stays valid).
  `.workbuddy-ai/` added to `.gitignore` so local agent workspace data stays out of `git status`.
- **ADR convention introduced (`docs/adr/`):** numbered Architecture Decision Records, immutable once
  accepted. **ADR 0001** records the sequencing decision for the v3 data migration, plus the finding
  that `artworks`, `media_assets`, `pages`, and `inquiries` have **no `CREATE TABLE` anywhere in the
  repo** — the database is therefore not reproducible from version control and `run-migrations.ts`
  would fail against a fresh project. It also corrects the v3 PRD's claim that no `multer` dependency
  exists.

### Completed (previously listed under "Planned & Staged")
- **Cloudinary deletion pass — done** (`406def2`): `cloudinaryMap.ts` deleted, the `/api/cloudinary/*`
  routes and the Cloudinary upload proxy removed, the `cloudinary` npm dependency uninstalled, and the
  image resolution chain is now Supabase-only (`external URL → asset registry → SVG fallback`). Root
  mapping JSONs relocated to `data/archive/`. (`multer` is retained — it powers the Supabase Storage
  upload route, not Cloudinary; see `AGENTS.md`.)
- **Database & security hardening — done** (`2026_09_13_v2_9_security_rls_hardening.sql`): RLS enabled
  on `taxonomies`, `artwork_terms`, and `settings` with public-read and admin/editor-write policies.
